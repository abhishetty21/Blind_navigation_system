# Blind Navigation System using Object Detection, Depth Estimation & Audio Feedback

This project is an assistive navigation system designed for visually impaired individuals. It combines object detection, depth estimation, and voice feedback to help users understand their surroundings in real time.

## 🧠 Overview

- **Object Detection:** Detects real-world objects using the RetinaNet-50 deep learning model.
- **Depth Estimation:** Calculates the distance of detected objects from the user using a hybrid MiDaS (Monocular Depth Estimation) model.
- **Voice Feedback:** Delivers real-time audio instructions based on the detected object and its distance from the user.

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time object detection using **RetinaNet-50**
- Accurate monocular depth estimation using **MiDaS**
- Audio feedback through system speaker/headphones
- Modular design with separate scripts for each task
